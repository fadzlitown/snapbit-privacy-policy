      <h1>SnapBit Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 4, 2025</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>SnapBit ("we", "our", or "the app") is a habit tracking application that helps users build positive habits through photo-based accountability. This privacy policy explains how we
  collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Account Information</h3>
      <p>When you sign in with Google, we collect your email address and display name for authentication purposes.</p>

      <h3>Photos</h3>
      <p>The app uses your device camera to capture habit completion photos. These photos are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly choose
  to backup or share them.</p>

      <h3>Habit Data</h3>
      <p>Your habit information (names, schedules, completion records) is stored locally on your device and synced to Firebase for backup purposes when you are signed in.</p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>To provide and maintain the app's functionality</li>
          <li>To sync your data across devices when signed in</li>
          <li>To verify subscription status for premium features</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
      <p>SnapBit requires camera access to capture photos as proof of habit completion. Camera access is only used when you explicitly take a photo within the app. We do not access your
  camera in the background.</p>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>Your data is stored:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Locally:</strong> Photos and habit data are stored on your device</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud:</strong> Account and habit data is synced to Firebase (Google Cloud) for backup</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication, data storage, and analytics</li>
          <li><strong>Google Play:</strong> Subscription management</li>
          <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Advertising (for free tier users)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties except as required to provide our services or comply with legal obligations.</p>

      <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>You can delete your account and all associated data by contacting us at the email below. Local data can be deleted by uninstalling the app.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>SnapBit is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
